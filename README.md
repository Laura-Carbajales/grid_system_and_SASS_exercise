# Training SASS and Grid system

## The challenge:

Create a website that distributes its content with a grid system and style it using SASS.

## Comments:

This is my first approach to the layout grid system. I have found it very useful and I wanted to share this fun exercise through my github profile, in which I have made a simple page to raise awareness of dog adoption.
On it, I have used the grid system in several of its components and to give them style I have practiced with SASS.
